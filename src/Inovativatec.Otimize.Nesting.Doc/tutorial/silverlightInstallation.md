This generally happens in case:
* you are accessing Otimize Nesting from a new or recently restored PC. Or an existing PC using a different user;
* your Windows or Microsoft Edge have received updates;

## 3. Why are you being asked to install Silverlight?

Otimize Nesting was developed using a technology that requires Silverlight, a Microsoft web browser plug-in.

Along the recent years, plug in technology in web browsers have been discontinued and are no longer supported, with the exception of Microsoft Edge, configured to run Otimize Nesting using Internet Explorer compatibility mode.

It is not 100% clear until when this option will be available, so we recommend using the most recent version of our product. For more details visit our [website](https://www.otimizenesting.com).

The Otimize Nesting version using the Silverlight PlugIn will not longer be update and will not accept new users.

Still, if you want to keep using the old version while it is support, read the following steps in the next session.
